abstract = {The Ar (87.3 K) and N2 (77.4 K) adsorption isotherms of six non-graphitized carbon blacks are compared to choose the best reference material for an accurate determination of surface area of porous carbons with subtracting pore effect (SPE) method using high resolution αs-plot. Microporous carbon blacks cannot be used as references for SPE method since they underestimate the surface area. On the other hand, reference carbon blacks exhibiting capillary condensation underestimate external surface areas. The total surface area from SPE method using Ar adsorption at 87.3 K has a stronger dependence on the microporosity of reference carbon blacks than that using N2 adsorption at 77.4 K. The surface area of carbons whose pore widths are >1 nm result more affected by the reference carbon black than those with widths <1 nm. The optimized reference data and calculation programs are provided in an open repository (https://osf.io/zjg8a) for quick and easy use of the SPE method to characterize the porous carbons precisely.}
